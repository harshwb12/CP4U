I made this project keeping in mind that I can get all the problems/study resources provided by my mentors at CodeISM at one place and use them efficiently. 
So in this website Users can create their own groups or join their admin/mentor's group.( Sample group id : 615ad9acc32530e954b9b260 ) 
This way you can access problemsets provided by admin or create your own problemset by simply creating your group. 
Additional features include 

1) Saving the status of a problem manually(like done or not done).
2) Adding a note to a certain problem.
3) Adding any problem as favourite.
4) Getting all the contest at codeforces,codechef,atcoder in upcoming 7 days.

Tech stack used 
1) Html , css , bootstrap , js
2) Node js , Express js , mongo db , ejs
